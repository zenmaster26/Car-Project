            <h2>The 2004 Honda Civic</h2>
            <img class="front" src="images/HondaA.2.jpg">
           <p>The 2004 Honda Civic is was a martyr of its time. This glorious example of perfect 
               engineering could bring tears to event the most hardened criminals. The fact that 
               most of you are showing no emotion is quite concerning, your names have been noted.

               She's truly a great car. Getting you 30 miles for every gallon of gas, with a 13 gallon tank that's like, over 300 miles man!
               It's a 4-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive, now i'm not gonna make any suggestions of what to do with that information, but maybe you know what to do.
               With 115 horse 1.7 liter engine with great fuel economy the car is great for anyone and everyone that wants to ride on the road.
               She also has many different options for your personal pleasure, many colors to choose from with different wheel types and body kits to customize!
               If you're a car guy, she's also highly modifiable and is great for any purpose you may need for it!
