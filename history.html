                <p>This is the origninal model of the Honda Civic. As you can see, there have been a multitude of reformations between the vehicles current state and 
                  its humble beginnings.

                stands as a reminder of what war brings to beauty. Over 20,000 jobs were lost in the conflict, and the topic is still considered 
                contriversial to this day.

                The current model of the Honda Civic. In its current state, nothing can surpass this ultimate lifeform, and quite frankley, there <i>is</i>
                 no reason to even attempt such a feat.
