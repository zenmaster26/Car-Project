            <p>This absolute unit known as the 2004 honda civic is infact, a very nice car. Starting off from its technical aspects alone this line of cars is known for it's great MPG, with some getting over 50 miles to the gallon.
            The civic line over all is a reliable and diverse line, ranging from family sedans to performance sport cars.
            The 2004 civic sedan itself is a nice car, capable of travelling long distances with it's great gas mileage and large size and comfortable seats.
            Civics are an amazing work of engineering on the part of honda, capable of filling many a variety of roles, these cars are clean, lean, and ready to go where ever you want.

            The Honda civic 2004 was, naturally released in 2004 as a large group of different cars, the one that shone the highest though was the 2004 sedan model.
            I mean, who has ever seen something so beautiful, so natural, such a marvel of creation roll out of a factory?
            With it's many possible options able to bring it to just below 200 horse power, what self-respecting family man could resist it?
            While there were other ones that people called "Better for the environment", the sedan truely dominated the roads with it's ability and style.</p>
